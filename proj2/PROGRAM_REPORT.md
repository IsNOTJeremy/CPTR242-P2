Compile the Main.cpp along with included files. Then operate the program with
keyboard inputs, following the prompts.

My experience with writing the tests prior to the program I did not enjoy, nor made sense to me. Also, I disliked the idea of completely
leaving the testing separate from the program proper, so I converted it into a .h file, and included the option to test if the program is
working.
