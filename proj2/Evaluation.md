There are several options available to me for data structures. I would be able to use linked lists, array lists, a stack, or qeues.

A pro for the linked lists would be that I would be able to add as many items to it as I wish, and will be able to traverse it.

A con for linked lists would be that I would be unable to get random access.

A pro for an array would be I would be able to access members easily.

A con for an array would be that I would have greater difficulty adding and removing members, as well as adding new members.

A pro for a stack would be that I would be able to proceed through the list, and it will be able to store the information.

A con for the stack would be that it is first come, first serve, and would be a bit more complicated in accessing information.

A pro for queue would be the oldest application would appear first.

A con for queue would be that there would be no random access.

I think I will go with either a linked list, or a queue, as I prefer those items. I would go with an array, if it were not for the fact

that Village Housing may get many applications, and larger lists are better done in a linked list rather than an array. I would choose a qeue

because it is able to behave like a linked list, and I would be able to easily keep track of which application was submitted first. A final

choice would be an array, as it is simple and easy to use, the only downside I feel is significant would be if the number of applicants were

too large.
